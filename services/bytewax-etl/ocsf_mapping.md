The Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF) provides a structured and standardized way to classify security events. A core component of this framework is the mapping of human-readable class names to unique numerical identifiers (IDs). This ensures that security data is consistently understood across different tools and platforms.

Below is a comprehensive list of OCSF classes and their corresponding IDs, organized by category.

---
## **1. System Activity**

This category pertains to events occurring at the operating system level.

| 1003 | Kernel Activity |
| 1004 | Memory Activity |
| 1005 | Module Activity |
| 1006 | Scheduled Job Activity |
| 1007 | Process Activity |

## **5. Discovery**

Events in this category relate to the discovery and inventory of assets.

| ID | Class Name |
| :--- | :--- |
| 5001 | Device Inventory Info |
| 5002 | Device Config State |

## **6. Application Activity**

This category covers events generated by applications.

| ID | Class Name |
